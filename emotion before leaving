Before the day i am going to Tokyo, Japan, i stay at home and accompany with my mom.
I am thinking whether this decision is correct, or maybe stay in my own country is also good.
I start to be hesitate at last, start to thinking about choosing an easier way of life.
However, only 6 hours, after that, i have to go. 
Good luck. I have much need to learn.
